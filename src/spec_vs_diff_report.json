  "summary": "The implementation covers most requirements comprehensively. Services and products pages display data from backend with proper retrieval and display. The service request form includes all required fields with validation and success confirmation. Backend implements stable types, CRUD operations, and stores service requests. Frontend applies a tech-focused visual theme with slate grays and electric green accents. Generated brand images (logo and hero background) are properly referenced in the code. However, several acceptance criteria are not fully met: no evidence of 3-5 pre-populated repair services in backend, no product categorization, no service request status tracking (pending/in-progress/completed), no contact information field in the form, and no stable variables for data persistence across upgrades.",
